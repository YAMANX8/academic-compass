      <br> <br>
        Why?
        <br> <br>
        Is it because "programming just isn't for everyone"?
        <br> <br>
        Or is it because only those with experience in hard sciences can learn it?
        <br> <br>
      <strong>  No, neither of those are true. </strong> It's simply due to the fact that the vast majority of people who try don't have a basic understanding of the technology they're going to use.
        <br> <br>
        How exactly can you tackle responsive design if you don't know how a browser works?
        <br> <br>
        How are you going to create a desktop application if you don't know what makes your computer freeze constantly (besides porn, obviously)?
        <br> <br>
        How are you going to hide your confused facial expression the next time your site's server crashes because of a "node socket problem" in your full stack Javascript?
        <br> <br>
        If you've ever taken your computer to a technician and said "Make it work" or "It don't work good. Me cry" then you're exactly who needs this course.
        <br> <br>
        Over the next 10 years the United States is expected to add over 2 million programming jobs. Jobs that pay well over $100,000 a year. And that's just the United States (Merica').
        <br> <br>
        So if you're trying to jump on the coding gravy train, put down your bronze statuette of Elon Musk standing on Mars, and start filling in the gaps in your "tech literacy". Even if you yourself do not become a "coding ninja" yourself all the future coding ninjas you work with with thank you (and tell you to stop calling them coding ninjas).`,
